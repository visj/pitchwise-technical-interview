# Pitchwise Technical Interview

Welcome to the Pitchwise technical interview! In this session, you will collaborate with us to implement parts of the Pitchwise system, a pitch deck reader and analytics tool designed for startups, particularly in the African tech space.

## **Objective**
During the interview, you will work on implementing specific parts of the system, as guided by the `TODO` comments in the source files. This is a live session, so feel free to ask questions and clarify requirements as we work together.

## **Project Overview**
The project is structured into the following key files:

- **`App.tsx`**: Contains the main frontend application logic.
- **`Engine.ts`**: Manages backend logic for randomizing and handling insights.
- **`mock.ts`**: Provides mock data for insights and actions.
- **`server.ts`**: Implements server functionality, including WebSocket and HTTP handling.
- **`types.ts`**: Defines TypeScript types for data structures used throughout the project.

## **Your Tasks**
1. **Frontend (`App.tsx`):**
   - Implement logic for displaying and dynamically updating insights, as marked by `* TODO Implementation below`.

2. **Backend Engine (`Engine.ts`):**
   - Complete the core logic for managing insights and handling mutations, as marked by `* TODO Add implementation below`.

3. **Type Definitions (`types.ts`):**
   - Define or refine the TypeScript types marked with `* TODO Implement these types`.

## **Setup Instructions**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:visj/pitchwise-technical-interview.git
   cd pitchwise-technical-interview
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
4. Navigate to `localhost:8080` in your browser.

## **Live Coding Session**
- The interview will last approximately **1 hour**.
- We will guide you through the implementation, focusing on the key areas marked with `TODO`.
- Feel free to ask questions or discuss your approach as we code along.

## **Evaluation Criteria**
We are looking for:
- **Problem-Solving Skills:** Your ability to understand the requirements and implement solutions.
- **Code Quality:** Clear, maintainable, and efficient code.
- **Collaboration:** Communication and teamwork during the session.
- **Understanding of Best Practices:** Use of TypeScript, modularization, and performance considerations.
